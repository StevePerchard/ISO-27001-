# Statement of Applicability (SoA) – CZ Ltd  
**Version 1.0 | 15 March 2025 | Approved by: Chief Technology Officer**

This Statement of Applicability identifies which of the 93 controls in **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A** are applicable to the CZ Ltd Information Security Management System (ISMS). The selection and justification of controls are derived from a formal risk assessment performed in March 2025 and are fully aligned with the defined ISMS scope, organisational context, interested parties, and legal/regulatory obligations of a UK-based, FCA-authorised FinTech operating a lending-as-a-service platform on Microsoft Azure (UK South & UK West regions).

Of the 93 Annex A controls, **89 are applicable** and have been implemented or are in the process of implementation. The four excluded controls were deemed not relevant following documented risk treatment decisions (see Risk Register R10, R18, R23, R31).

### Linkage to ISO 27001:2022 Clauses
- **Clause 4 – Context of the organisation**: Scope limited to Azure UK regions, Microsoft 365 tenant, and supporting processes handling UK-GDPR PII and financial data (see Scope Statement).
- **Clause 4.2 – Needs and expectations of interested parties**: Requirements from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), credit reference agencies (Experian, Equifax), and customers have driven controls A.5.5, A.5.19–A.5.23, A.5.31, and A.5.34.
- **Clause 5 – Leadership**: Top management commitment evidenced by the signed Information Security Policy and defined roles (CISO, CTO, Compliance Officer).
- **Clause 6.1 – Actions to address risks and opportunities**: All applicable controls were selected as risk treatment options following the March 2025 risk assessment (see Risk Register & Risk Treatment Plan).
- **Clause 6.1.3 – Information security risk treatment**: Non-applicable controls are explicitly justified and accepted by the CTO (residual risk = negligible).
- **Clause 9.3 – Management review**: The SoA is reviewed annually and after any significant change (next review scheduled July 2025).

This SoA forms an integral part of CZ Ltd’s journey toward ISO 27001:2022 certification targeted for Q4 2025.
